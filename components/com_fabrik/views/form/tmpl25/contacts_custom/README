Documentation for this template will go here!

This template is designed to be used with the example Contact Us form, but
is intended as a generic example of how to create a custom form template,
allowing you to individually place and style each element.

To install this template, unzip it (which you have probably already done
as you are reading this file!), and upload the 'contacts_custom' folder to:

./components/com_fabrik/views/form/tmpl

... on your server.  Then edit your Contact Us form settings, and select it as
the template to use.
